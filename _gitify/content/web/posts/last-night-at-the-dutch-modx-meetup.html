        <p>What happens in Alkmaar, apparently doesn't stay in Alkmaar! Last night, a group of 11 MODX developers and designers (including a German and Belgian) came together at the RAADHUIS office in&nbsp;Alkmaar, The Netherlands, for a&nbsp;MODX Meetup. The meetup included pizza and 4 talks around the subject "Workflow".</p>

<h2>First things first: Pizza &amp; Drinks</h2>

<p>The hosts of this meetup took great care of the attendees by providing much-appreciated pizza, beer and other drinks. The RAADHUIS team gave a quick tour of the office and talked about the history of the agency, as well as the unique&nbsp;building, before officially&nbsp;kicking off the meetup with the first talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Talk 1: Project Workflow by Jörgen</h2>

<p>The first talk was by the host of the meetup Jörgen Holzman (<strong>check name spelling</strong>). He gave a talk about the general project workflow at RAADHUIS and the different stages that is in. He also followed with a description of their "basic"&nbsp;website workflow, which includes creating a copy of&nbsp;a base site hosted on MODX cloud and developing there until the site was ready for production, which is when they would extract the site onto their reseller hosting.</p><p>One of the interesting parts of the general workflow at RAADHUIS is that their roots are very much offline&nbsp;design oriented. In their project&nbsp;workflow, this is recognised in the fact that most projects start with the design phase, which are then turned into markup and later a MODX site by other members of the team. This led to quite a bit of interesting discussion with a room full of people that primarily work online.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Talk 2: RAADHUIS Workflow 2.0 by Henk (Bart)</h2>

<p>Next up was Jörgen's&nbsp;colleague Henk, whose real name is Bart but because there are already two other Barts at RAADHUIS they just call him Henk instead. Henk, or Bart, talked about their MODX development workflow version two that they have been implementing more&nbsp;recently. On top of what they've already been doing, this iteration leans heavily on Grunt for handling deployments to client servers over FTP - an interesting use case for Grunt, which most people only use for compiling and&nbsp;compressing various assets.</p>

<h2>Talk 3: Iterating on Workflows by Gauke Pieter</h2>

<p>After a break, Gauke Pieter followed with a presentation showing how their development&nbsp;workflow changed and improved over the years. Starting with working directly online, and eventually getting to a point where the workflow is dominated by a standardised&nbsp;Vagrant machine and a dedicated centralised&nbsp;MySQL server, the Sterc team made the most out of a situation where the internet connection is fairly limited and the growth of the team led them to work offline a lot more.&nbsp;</p><p>With this workflow, developers can work on their local machine until the project&nbsp;is ready for the&nbsp;staging server and eventually production.</p>

<h2>Talk 4: Solving the Workflow by Mark</h2>

<p>At several moments during the earlier talks, my own presentation came to mind of being a perfect solution for some of the cons of the discussed workflow. With the title I chose for the talk, luckily there was no pressure!</p><p>In my talk I introduced MODX.today as example project for working with Gitify. Gitify is a command line toolkit that gives you the ability to easily create file-based representations of any MODX object (resources, elements, settings, users, form customisation, ACLs, third party packages..) that can be committed to git, and restored into a MODX installation later or on a different server.</p><p>In combination with the utilities that Gitify also has, we discussed a workflow similar to the one we actually use for MODX.today to set up an actual workflow that can work for you. Followed by some ways of how the deployments can be automated and a quick demo, the attendees seemed really impressed by what Gitify can do.&nbsp;</p>
