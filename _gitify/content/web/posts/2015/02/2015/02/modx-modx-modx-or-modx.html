<p>Throughout the history of our awesome CMS, figuring out how the word is capitalised hasn't always been easy. MODX.today answers this live long question.</p><p>The confusion is understandable.

<p>I believe the relaunch and rebranding the FAQ refers to, is the one that happened around the CMS Expo,&nbsp;<a href="http://modx.com/blog/2012/05/17/no-more-hiding-in-plain-sight/">back in May 2012</a>. There, the logo went from having &nbsp;many stripes in a ton of different colors, to just three simple, coloured stripes forming an X.</p>

<p><a href="http://modx.com/blog/2014/07/16/the-next-decade-of-modx/">Even more recently</a>, for MODX its 10th birthday,&nbsp;the logo was simplified some more, bringing us to the folded logo that heads up MODX today. As expected, in full caps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>So why is there still confusion?</h2>

<p>Well, a search on Google Images for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=modx+logo" target="_blank">MODX Logo</a> may give an idea. Over the years, the&nbsp;project has seen many logo variations and they haven't always used the full uppercase name. Especially the old logo from the Evolution days (<a href="http://modx.com/company/blog/2009/06/06/separated-at-birth/" target="_blank">which was eventually&nbsp;discontinued because of striking&nbsp;similarities to another logo</a>) shows why some of the older community members may still prefer the lowercase "modx".</p>

        <p>There is also another reason people use other variations: Code.</p><p>The MODX manager uses javascript library which uses the global variable "<em>MODx</em>", with a lowercase x.
