<h2>How XRouting works	</h2>

<p>XRouting uses context settings for it's routing. That's why you should add at least the <em>http_host</em>, <em>base_url</em> and <em>site_url</em> context settings to each context. To make your multilingual website actually work you should also add settings like <em>cultureKey</em>, <em>site_start</em> and <em>error_page</em>.</p><p>Assuming that you're creating a website that is translated into English, French and German, with a single domain and a&nbsp;subfolder for each language – so the English website would be available under http://company.org/en/. In that case you should leave the default web context&nbsp;and create 3 new contexts.&nbsp;Your context settings for the english context should look similar to those in the image blow.</p>

<h2>What you also need</h2>

<p>In order to finish your multilingual website you might want to redirect your visitors from the main domain company.org to a specific language version. This could be done by a&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/christianseel/504302ce8ddfcde009c0" target="_blank">snippet</a> in the resource in the web context, that automatically redirects the user based on it's browser language or by a simple weblink that is set as the global <em>site_start</em> in the web&nbsp;context and that redirects to the default language.</p><p>In order to let visitors switch between languages I recommend the&nbsp;<a href="http://modx.com/extras/package/babel" target="_blank">Babel</a> extra, which is just about to reach the 3.0 version. With Babel you can link your translations from the MODX Manager and with a simple snippet in your template you can add the links to the other languages to the front-end. This is how the Babel snippet call could look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&#91;&#91;BabelLinks? &amp;tpl=`babelLanguageTabs` &amp;showCurrent=`1` &amp;includeUnlinked=`1`&#93;&#93;</code></pre>
