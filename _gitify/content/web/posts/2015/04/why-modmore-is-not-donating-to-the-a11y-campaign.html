	MODX has started a campaign looking to crowdfund a more accessible manager, <a href="[[~16]]" style="background-color: initial;" class="">which you can read about here</a>.

<h2>What is accessibility about, really?</h2>

<p>There has been a lot of discussions within the modmore team about what the accessibility project achieves, and what its merits are. If anything, it is a step in the right direction and accessibility is rightly getting more attention within the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the privileged people at modmore also have concerns about the way the project goes about achieving this. Obviously, as long as it is built on top of ExtJS, it is going to be near impossible to get pure accessibility. There will always be a reliance on the javascript, which dynamically generates pretty much all of the underlying DOM, resulting in a manager that is unlikely to be fully accessible any time soon.&nbsp;</p><p>As said though, it is a step in the right direction. By improving keyboard accessibility and contrast, there are real benefits to the work the team is doing.</p>

<h2>Side-stepping the problem with a Theme</h2>

<p>Because it is a step in the right direction, we're not sure developing it as a separate theme was the best idea. There are of course benefits to using a separate theme, for example not having to go through the usual&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">core&nbsp;contributing workflow</a> for every change and having more freedom to explore improvements that might be hard to sell to the entire core team.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you're not implementing accessibility in the core, does MODX really advance? When implemented nicely, there is definitely room for more contrast and keyboard accessibility in the&nbsp;MODX core and standard theme. By putting it in a separate theme, you are both setting yourself up for maintaining a second manager that will need to be updated whenever the core theme is updated, and secondly accessibility is made opt-in to those that know how to install&nbsp;a manager theme.</p><p>As accessibility is meant to make information available&nbsp;for all, this is a principle issue with the accessibility initiative that put us off from contributing to the campaign directly.</p>

<h2>What we're doing instead</h2>

<p>So instead of contributing the campaign by donating, we've decided to take another approach to support accessibility in MODX... investing in the accessibility of our own products!&nbsp;</p><p>We've already brought it up with Imperavi, the developers for Redactor, who have indicated they are planning on making&nbsp;accessibility improvements later this year. For ContentBlocks and MoreGallery we've also completed a very high level analysis of where we're at (spoiler: lots of opportunity to improve), so we're looking to make improvements especially&nbsp;around keyboard navigation and contrast in the next releases. We've also found some ways to get stuck in certain ContentBlocks inputs and Redactor&nbsp;if you only navigate with the keyboard, and that's on our list to research further as well.&nbsp;</p><p>So even though the A11Y crowdfunding campaign hasn't resulted in us giving a financial contribution, it has made us think about what we're doing and it definitely accomplished a goal there.</p>

<h2>What are you going to do</h2>

<p>Despite our concerns about the accessibility project, we still think it is a better initiative than not having one at all, so it is a good idea to consider making a donation to the project.&nbsp;Accessibility is something that eventually concerns everyone, and it's a good thing to think about it and look for ways to improve it. We've decided to focus on our own projects first.&nbsp;</p><p>What can you do to promote&nbsp;accessibility?</p>
