<p>Over the past few weeks, lead architect Jason "opengeek" Coward has been sharing his vision about the future of MODX on Medium. Based on that, and other discussions, what do we know about MODX 3?&nbsp;</p><p>To be honest, not all that much yet. There are bits and pieces we can put together, but&nbsp;as MODX 3 simply&nbsp;isn't here yet, it's all guesswork. While not as mystical as a unicorn, MODX 3 is definitely a long-term project that is barely getting started.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why do we need MODX 3?</h2>

<p>The current version of MODX suits a lot of people really well. It enables designers and front-end developers to build completely bespoke websites with minimal effort and core&nbsp;hacking unlike some of the competition. Even in the current iteration, building&nbsp;websites will be easy and completely feasible for many years to come. The very powerful templating language, template variables and addons like ContentBlocks are all ready for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Arguably, the biggest reasons for a MODX 3 are to clean up the legacy code, empower developers with better industry standard&nbsp;tools and to eradicate long-standing issues that stand in the way of large(r) scale adoption in the development world.&nbsp;</p><p>These reasons are mostly related to the architecture of MODX - the underlying code that powers the entire system and make things&nbsp;work. And that's where Jason "opengeek" Coward his ideas come in, as chief architect for the MODX CMS.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Not Invented Here Syndrom</h2>

<p>If you've read the <em>Keeping MODX Relevant </em>series by Jason (part one, part two, part three), there are a few things that stand out worth reiterating.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, the concept of <em><strong>Not Invented Here (NIH)</strong> </em>needs to go. This basically means that where previously every part of the code&nbsp;was developed internally, in the future we will see more and more external libraries being used. This shift has happened across the PHP community over the past few&nbsp;years, in part thanks to initiatives like the PHP <em>Framework Inoperability Group </em>defining various&nbsp;code standards, Composer and Packagist making it extremely easy to use code from third parties and the rise of libraries that are exceptionally good at one, well-defined tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>By adopting these third party libraries, it is possible to develop solid applications quicker and&nbsp;better by taking advantage of fully unit tested code. Given how MODX currently doesn't really have any useful unit tests, this is a very big deal when it comes to an architecture and code quality perspective.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is Slim, and why use that?</h2>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@drumshaman/keeping-modx-relevant-part-two-15a37eab5b48" target="_blank">In part two of the Keeping MODX Relevant series</a>, Jason mentioned&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slimframework.com/" target="_blank">Slim</a> (v3) as the likely candidate to be at the very core of MODX. This has not gone unnoticed, with many people looking into Slim, wondering what it does, and how it will work.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what you need to know about Slim:</p><ul><li>Slim is a router. It translates Requests (for example <em>GET /manager/resource/update</em>)&nbsp;into a&nbsp;Response (for example a form to update a resource),&nbsp;based on a controller of sorts.</li><li>Slim follows what is called the <em>Middleware </em>pattern. With this pattern, you essentially get multiple layers that each process the request, and the response, with the ability of changing them before they hit the next layer.&nbsp;<a href="http://docs-new.slimframework.com/concepts/middleware/" target="_blank">A&nbsp;technical explanation of the middleware&nbsp;pattern can be found here</a>.&nbsp;The middleware pattern is a very powerful way of extending behaviour. Slim 3 actually follows the PSR-7 (draft)&nbsp;standard from the&nbsp;PHP FIG in its middleware implementation, which means any PSR-7 middleware can be used with Slim 3 as well.&nbsp;</li><li>Slim is small: only NNN kb.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Presumably, Slim will take the place of what are currently modManagerController instances in the Revolution core, and perhaps&nbsp;even the front-end routing to resources. Given the ability to add middlewares, that would make an extremely flexible and powerful system - even before you think about what you can do with the&nbsp;MODX core contained inside...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What about the Manager and ExtJS?</h2>

<p>If you ask a random&nbsp;group of MODXers about their least favourite part of the system, it is quite likely ExtJS (or more generally the way the manager is built) ranks incredibly&nbsp;high on that list.&nbsp;At this point there does not seem to be any confirmed direction or framework a new manager would be built on, but sticking with ExtJS 3.4 is likely not going to happen. ExtJS 3 is very old, not very fast or mobile friendly,&nbsp;and it no longer receives updates as ExtJS has since hit version 5.&nbsp;</p><p>So while we don't know what the new manager will look like, or what it will be built with yet, we can be pretty confident it wont be ExtJS 3. But what do we know?</p><p>Given Jason's choice for Slim as the core library to build on, his work on something called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opengeek/tacit" target="_blank">Tacit</a> (a high performance RESTful framework, perhaps not very coincidentally&nbsp;based on Slim)&nbsp;and some of the discussions on IRC and the Ambassadors channel, it seems likely the next manager will see&nbsp;a RESTful API as base. The current manager also has a custom API of sorts, but its structure is geared towards what ExtJS expects; and it is definitely not RESTful.&nbsp;The API and front-end will likely be separated from the manager further than what is the case currently. The idea behind that is that with a solid RESTful API, the manager (or manager<strong>s</strong>, if you ask certain people)&nbsp;can be developed separately from the core service.&nbsp;</p>
