<p>We publish a variety of types of articles, with their own specific requirements indicated below. These are more <em>guidelines </em>than hard requirements, but please do keep them in mind when writing your article.</p><p>For all types of&nbsp;articles, here's what we look for:</p><ol><li>It has a direct relation to MODX. Articles about HTML5 may be interesting to our readers, but we are still called <em>MODX.today </em>so it has to be about something MODX.</li><li>No reposts. If there's a great article elsewhere on the web that is a great fit for our readers, we have a Link article type for that.</li><li>Keep it friendly. We will not accept harassment, racism, overly foul language, anything&nbsp;illegal, or otherwise&nbsp;morally or ethically unsatisfactory articles.&nbsp;</li><li>Articles about commercial offerings are fine, but it should not be an advertisement. We prefer publishing&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;over press releases, so know the difference. If you are directly involved with building a commercial offering, maybe one of your users is interested in writing an independent post instead?</li><li>When you submit a post, you acknowledge that you have the legal&nbsp;right to publish any and all content in the article, including media rights for images and permission to discuss&nbsp;privileged information if any.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>

<h2>Types of Articles</h2>

<p>MODX.today was built with different types of articles in mind. If you have a great idea for a different type of article not yet covered, please do let us know.</p><h3>1.&nbsp;Regular (Text)</h3><p>A Regular (Text) article is one that is all about written content. It may contain images, references to other websites or articles and other media, but is primarily about the written text.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Video</h3><p>The Video type has a single video that is the primary source of information. It will be embedded&nbsp;on the MODX.today homepage, and shown full-width on the article detail page. The video type may&nbsp;contain&nbsp;a transcript, review or other text describing&nbsp;the video below the embed. Videos need to be hosted on YouTube or Vimeo preferably.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Image Gallery</h3><p>Aimed for photo-reviews of events such as meetups or conferences, the image gallery type shows three images on the MODX.today homepage, and a full gallery on&nbsp;the article detail page. Additional content can be added below the gallery.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Link</h3><p>As there is so many great content on the web, the Link type was built to provide a simple external&nbsp;links on the homepage. The link type contains a 2-3 sentence summary displayed on our site and&nbsp;a custom "Read more" link text. It does not have an article detail page on MODX.today.&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Podcast</h3><p>The podcast type is currently restricted only to the MODX.today podcast and contains embedded audio. If you wish to be a guest&nbsp;on the MODX.today&nbsp;podcast, please let us know.&nbsp;</p>
